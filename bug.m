In Objective-C, a common yet subtle error arises when dealing with memory management, specifically with the interaction between ARC (Automatic Reference Counting) and properties declared without proper attributes.  For example:

```objectivec
@property (nonatomic) MyCustomObject *myObject;
```

If `MyCustomObject` is not properly managed (e.g., it doesn't follow the standard Objective-C memory management rules or has a custom dealloc method doing non-standard memory management), assigning a value to `myObject` may cause unexpected behavior.  This is because ARC's automatic retain/release operations may clash with the object's own lifecycle, leading to memory leaks or crashes.

Another example involves using `retain` and `release` manually within a custom setter method when ARC is enabled. It may introduce memory leaks, double releasing, or other memory-related errors. The correct practice is to avoid manual memory management when ARC is active.
